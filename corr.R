# Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a 
# threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation
# between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the
# number of completely observed cases (on all variables) is 
# greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector
# of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement.
# If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function 
# should return a numeric vector of length 0. A prototype of this 
# function follows

## Author John D. Garcia
## Purpose: Find the correlation between to variables.  
## We will use the complete.R function found in my Github
## account.  It is a dependancy.  If you do not trust my 
## complete.R function, then you should use complete.cases
## R implementation.  You may have to perform some modifications 
## to this code to get it to work properly.  Cheers!

corr <- function( directory, threshold = 0){
  ## directory is a character vector to the 
  ## path where our files reside.
